# BackwardsDog [Arduino Project]
Code for walking robot: quadruped (SHAPE program at Columbia University)

This project, **WalkingDog**, is a small Arduino-based code exercise to move a robot "forward." The code is written in an Arduino `.ino` file called `Make_it_go_forward.ino`, which provides instructions for the robot to initiate forward movement.

## Project Structure

- `Make_it_go_forward/` - Directory containing all Arduino files and code.
  - `Make_it_go_forward.ino` - The main Arduino code that drives the robot forward.

## Requirements

To use this project, youâ€™ll need:
- An Arduino-compatible board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Motors and motor driver circuitry compatible with the Arduino
- Basic knowledge of Arduino programming and circuit assembly

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phinance650/BackwardsDog.git
